_CONCEPT_IDENTIFICATION_TEMPLATE = """You are a legal concept annotator. Given a chunk of legal text, identify every legal concept that appears in the text.

For each concept found, provide:
1. **concept_text**: The exact text span as it appears in the document
2. **branch_hints**: A list of FOLIO ontology branches (1-3, most likely first) this concept belongs to
3. **confidence**: Your confidence (0.0-1.0) that this is a legal concept, calibrated as follows:
   - 0.95 = unambiguous legal term of art (e.g., "habeas corpus", "res judicata")
   - 0.70 = context-dependent legal term (e.g., "consideration" in a contract context)
   - 0.50 = ambiguous term that could be legal or general (e.g., "party", "motion")
   - 0.30 = weak signal, only legal in very specific contexts (e.g., "interest", "relief")

FOLIO ontology branches (with representative concepts and definitions):
{branch_info}

Rules:
- Include both explicit legal terms (e.g., "breach of contract") and contextual legal concepts (e.g., "damages" when used in a legal sense)
- Use the EXACT text as it appears — do not paraphrase or normalize
- A concept can be 1-5 words long
- Match the complete phrase as it appears in the text. Use "breach of contract" rather than just "breach" when the full phrase is present, but do not infer a more specific sub-concept that isn't in the text (e.g., do not turn "cause of action" into "failure to state a cause of action")
- Do not include common English words that are not legal concepts in context
- Do NOT identify "area of law" categories (e.g., "litigation", "corporate law", "real estate law") — these are document-level classifications, not text-level concepts

Respond with JSON:
{{"concepts": [{{"concept_text": "...", "branch_hints": ["...", "..."], "confidence": 0.95}}]}}

TEXT:
