"""Per-ontology configuration: coordinates, normalization/exclusion behavior.

Each ontology is described by an :class:`OntologySpec`. FOLIO's spec carries the
exact values that used to live as module-level constants in ``folio_service.py``
and ``branch_config.py`` — so routing FOLIO through the registry is a pure
refactor with no behavior change. The Catholic Semantic Canon is defined here too
(validated loadable via the Phase 0 spike) but is only instantiated when listed in
``settings.enabled_ontologies``.

Fields are added as their consumers land, not speculatively — the frontend brand
label, per-ontology OWL filename/repo coords, etc. arrive with the phases that use
them.
